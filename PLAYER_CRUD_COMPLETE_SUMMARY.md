# Player CRUD Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented all remaining CRUD operations for player roster management, completing the full player management system.

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. Lambda Handlers (4 New Functions)

#### **List Players** (`src/players/list/handler.py`)
- **Endpoint:** `GET /teams/{teamId}/players`
- **Authorization:** All team members can view roster
- **Features:**
  - Query all players on a team roster
  - Optional filters: `status` (active/inactive/sub), `isGhost` (true/false)
  - Smart sorting: playerNumber (ascending, nulls last) → lastName → firstName
  - Returns count + player array
- **Response:** `200 OK` with `{ players: [...], count: N }`

#### **Get Player** (`src/players/get/handler.py`)
- **Endpoint:** `GET /teams/{teamId}/players/{playerId}`
- **Authorization:** All team members can view
- **Features:**
  - Direct lookup of single player
  - Returns full player object
- **Response:** `200 OK` with player data
- **Errors:** `404 Not Found` if player doesn't exist

#### **Update Player** (`src/players/update/handler.py`)
- **Endpoint:** `PUT /teams/{teamId}/players/{playerId}`
- **Authorization:** team-owner or team-coach only
- **Updatable Fields:**
  - `firstName` - validated (1-30 chars, letters/hyphens, single word)
  - `lastName` - validated, can be set to null to remove
  - `playerNumber` - validated (0-99), can be set to null to remove
  - `status` - validated (active/inactive/sub)
- **Read-Only Fields:** Rejects updates to `playerId`, `teamId`, `isGhost`, `userId`, `linkedAt`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `PK`, `SK`
- **Response:** `200 OK` with updated player data
- **Features:**
  - Dynamic UpdateExpression generation
  - Automatic `updatedAt` timestamp
  - Handles null values for optional fields

#### **Remove Player** (`src/players/remove/handler.py`)
- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /teams/{teamId}/players/{playerId}`
- **Authorization:** team-owner or team-coach only
- **Delete Policy:** Hard delete for ghost players only
- **Protection:** Cannot delete linked players (userId != null)
- **Response:** `204 No Content`
- **Errors:** `400 Bad Request` if player is linked

## 🔧 Infrastructure Updates

### Terraform Configuration (`terraform/lambda-players.tf`)
Added 4 new Lambda modules:
- `list_players_lambda` - 30 second timeout for large rosters
- `get_player_lambda` - 10 second timeout
- `update_player_lambda` - 10 second timeout
- `remove_player_lambda` - 10 second timeout

All configured with:
- Python 3.13 runtime
- ARM64 architecture
- 128 MB memory
- Appropriate DynamoDB permissions (Query, GetItem, UpdateItem, DeleteItem)
- 7-day CloudWatch log retention

### API Gateway (`terraform/api-gateway.tf`)
Added 4 new routes with JWT authorization:
- `GET /teams/{teamId}/players`
- `GET /teams/{teamId}/players/{playerId}`
- `PUT /teams/{teamId}/players/{playerId}`
- `DELETE /teams/{teamId}/players/{playerId}`

Added corresponding Lambda permissions for API Gateway invocation.

## 🧪 Testing Updates

### Test Script (`scripts/test_players.py`)
Added comprehensive test functions:
- `list_players(user_id, team_id, status, is_ghost)` - List with filters
- `get_player(user_id, team_id, player_id)` - Get single player
- `update_player(user_id, team_id, player_id, **updates)` - Update fields
- `remove_player(user_id, team_id, player_id)` - Remove player

### Full Test Suite Enhancements
The `full-test` command now includes:
- **TEST 7:** List Players
  - List all players
  - Filter by status (active only)
  - Filter by ghost status
- **TEST 8:** Get Player
  - Retrieve single player
  - Test 404 for non-existent player
- **TEST 9:** Update Player
  - Update firstName
  - Add lastName
  - Update playerNumber
  - Update status
  - Remove lastName (set to null)
  - Reject read-only field updates
- **TEST 10:** Remove Player
  - Remove ghost player (hard delete)
  - Verify deletion
  - Test 404 for non-existent player

### Command-Line Interface
New commands available:
```bash
# List players
uv run python scripts/test_players.py list <userId> <teamId> [status] [isGhost]

# Get player
uv run python scripts/test_players.py get <userId> <teamId> <playerId>

# Update player
uv run python scripts/test_players.py update <userId> <teamId> <playerId> <field> <value>

# Remove player
uv run python scripts/test_players.py remove <userId> <teamId> <playerId>
```

## 📚 Documentation Updates

### DATA_MODEL.md
Added 4 new access patterns:
- **Access Pattern 14:** List Team Players (Query with sorting)
- **Access Pattern 15:** Get Single Player (Direct lookup)
- **Access Pattern 16:** Update Player (Dynamic UpdateExpression)
- **Access Pattern 17:** Remove Player (Hard delete ghost players only)

Updated Player Routes table with all 5 endpoints.

Updated Player Testing section with comprehensive examples.

### ARCHITECTURE.md
Updated Lambda Function Breakdown to mark as implemented:
- ✅ `list-players`
- ✅ `get-player`
- ✅ `update-player`
- ✅ `remove-player`

## 🔐 Authorization Matrix

| Operation | Owner | Coach | Assistant | Player | Viewer |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| List players | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Get player | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Add player | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Update player | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Remove player | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Hard Delete for Ghost Players
- **Rationale:** Ghost players have no historical data yet
- **Protection:** Linked players (with userId) cannot be deleted
- **Future:** Unlink operation will handle preservation when needed

### 2. Sorting Strategy
- **Primary:** playerNumber (ascending)
- **Secondary:** lastName (alphabetical)
- **Tertiary:** firstName (alphabetical)
- **Nulls last:** Players without numbers appear at the end

### 3. Update Flexibility
- **Nullable fields:** lastName and playerNumber can be removed
- **Required fields:** firstName and status must always have values
- **Read-only protection:** Prevents accidental modification of system fields

### 4. All-Member Viewing
- **View access:** All team members (including viewers) can see roster
- **Edit access:** Only owners and coaches can modify roster
- **Rationale:** Transparency for all members, controlled management

```bash
# Package all Lambda functions
python scripts/package_lambdas.py

# Deploy infrastructure
cd terraform && terraform apply
```

### Ready for Testing

uv run python scripts/test_players.py full-test 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```

### API Endpoints Available (After Deployment)
```
POST   /teams/{teamId}/players              - Add player
