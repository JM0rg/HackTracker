## üß† 3. Domain Model

### Implemented Entities ‚úÖ

| Entity        | Description                                                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**      | Registered app user (Cognito account) - can own/join multiple teams       |
| **Player**    | Roster slot on a team - can be "ghost" (unlinked) or linked to a User     |
| **Team**      | Collection of players, schedule, stats - owned by a User. Can be MANAGED (full roster) or PERSONAL (stat filtering label) |
| **Game**      | Individual match with scheduledStart, opponent, location, scores, and lineup |

### Future Features (Planned, Not Yet Implemented)

| Entity        | Description                                                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **League**    | Organizer of multiple teams, seasons, and tournaments                      |
| **Season**    | Group of games belonging to either a team or league                        |
| **AtBat**     | Single play event (atomic unit of stat tracking) - always linked to Player |
| **FreeAgent** | Player advertising availability to teams                                   |
| **Invite**    | Pending invitation to join a team (email-based, 1 week expiration)         |

### User vs Player Distinction

**Critical Concept:** Users and Players are separate entities.

| Concept    | Description                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **User**   | A person with a Cognito account (userId = Cognito sub)                        |
| **Player** | A roster slot on a team (playerId = UUID) - may or may not be linked to User  |
| **Link**   | Connection between User and Player (`TEAM#id ‚Üí PLAYER#playerId ‚Üí userId`)     |

**Why This Matters:**
- A User can be linked to multiple Players (one per team they're on)
- A Player can exist without a User ("ghost player" - coach creates roster slot first)
- When a User leaves a team, the Player record remains (preserves team's historical stats)
- When a User deletes their account, they're unlinked from Players (stats stay with team)

**Example Flow:**
1. Coach creates Team ‚Üí adds 10 "ghost" Players to roster
2. Coach invites User via email ‚Üí links User to specific Player
3. User accepts ‚Üí now linked to that Player on that Team
4. User records at-bats ‚Üí stored under Player (which is linked to User)
5. User leaves Team ‚Üí link broken, but Player + at-bats remain for team
6. User can still query their historical stats from that Team

**See:** [api/dynamodb-design.md](./api/dynamodb-design.md) for data model details

---

## üîê 4. Authorization System

HackTracker uses a **v2 Policy Engine** for authorization.

### Key Concepts

**Team-Scoped Roles (Implemented):**
- `owner` - Full control, can delete team
- `manager` - Manage roster, schedule games, record stats
- `player` - View team data, edit own profile
- `scorekeeper` - Record stats during games

**Policy Engine Pattern:**
```python
# Handlers just ask: "can this user do X?"
authorize(table, user_id, team_id, action='manage_roster')

# They don't need to know WHO can do X
# That's defined in the central POLICY_MAP

POLICY_MAP = {
    'manage_roster': ['owner', 'manager'],
    'manage_team': ['owner', 'manager'],
    'delete_team': ['owner'],
    'manage_games': ['owner', 'manager', 'scorekeeper'],
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Handlers are "dumb" - zero knowledge of roles
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth - all permissions in one place
- ‚úÖ Future-proof - add roles without touching handlers
- ‚úÖ Self-documenting - policy map shows all permissions

**See:** [api/authorization.md](./api/authorization.md) for complete details

---

## üíæ 5. Data Architecture

### Single-Table Design

All entities stored in one DynamoDB table for optimal performance and cost efficiency.

**Table:** `hacktracker-{environment}`

**Primary Keys:**
- `PK` (Partition Key): Entity identifier (e.g., `USER#<id>`, `TEAM#<id>`)
- `SK` (Sort Key): Sub-entity or metadata (e.g., `METADATA`, `PLAYER#<id>`)

**Global Secondary Indexes (5):**
1. **GSI1** - User lookup by Cognito sub (login flow)
2. **GSI2** - Entity listing (generic queries for users, teams, games)
3. **GSI3** - Games by team (team schedule and game history) ‚úÖ
4. **GSI4** - User's players (cross-team stats) - Reserved for future
5. **GSI5** - Player's at-bats (stat aggregation) - Reserved for future

**Key Principles:**
- Most queries use PK/SK directly (no GSI needed)
- Atomic transactions for related writes
- Conditional writes prevent race conditions
- Cognito sub used as userId (no cross-referencing)

**See:** [api/dynamodb-design.md](./api/dynamodb-design.md) for complete schema

## üé® 6. Frontend Architecture

### State Management

**Technology:** Riverpod 3.0+

**Pattern:** Persistent caching with stale-while-revalidate (SWR) + Race-Condition-Safe Optimistic UI

**Key Features:**
- **Persistent cache** - Data survives app restarts
- **Cache versioning** - Auto-clear on schema changes
- **Instant UX** - Cached data shown immediately
- **Background refresh** - Fresh data fetched automatically
- **Optimistic updates** - UI reacts instantly to user actions
- **Safe rollback** - Handles concurrent operations correctly

**Flow:**
```
User opens screen
  ‚Üì
Show cached data instantly (if available)
  ‚Üì
Fetch fresh data in background
  ‚Üì
Update UI when fresh data arrives
```

**Optimistic UI Pattern:**
```dart
await notifier.mutate(
  optimisticUpdate: (current) => /* add/update/remove */,
  apiCall: () => api.doSomething(),
  applyResult: (current, result) => /* apply real result */,
  rollback: (current) => /* undo from current state */,
  successMessage: 'Success!',
  errorMessage: (e) => 'Failed: $e',
);
```

**See:** 
- [ui/state-management.md](./ui/state-management.md) for Riverpod patterns
- [OPTIMISTIC_UI_GUIDE.md](../OPTIMISTIC_UI_GUIDE.md) for detailed implementation

## üß© 7. Ownership Model

Every major entity (Season, Game, Tournament) has a single **owner**:

* **Team-owned** ‚Üí editable by team
* **League-owned** ‚Üí editable by league only
* Teams get **read-only mirrors** of league-owned records

| Entity          | Owner        | Editable By  | Visible To                   |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| League          | League Admin | League Admin | All teams                    |
| Team            | Coach/Owner  | Coach/Owner  | Players                      |
| Season (team)   | Team         | Team         | Team                         |
| Season (league) | League       | League Admin | All linked teams (read-only) |
| Game (team)     | Team         | Team         | Team                         |
| Game (league)   | League       | League Admin | Linked teams (read-only)     |

## üîÑ 8. Lifecycle Flows

### 8.1 Player Flow

1. Sign up ‚Üí Cognito triggers `post-confirmation` Lambda ‚Üí Creates `USER#id`
2. Player can:
   * Create MANAGED teams (full roster management)
   * Create PERSONAL teams (for filtering stats by team/season context)
   * Join an existing team via invite code
   * Join free agent pool (optional)

### 8.2 Team Flow

**MANAGED Teams:**
1. Coach creates a MANAGED team (`TEAM#id` with `team_type: MANAGED`)
2. Owner player is auto-created and linked
3. Adds additional players manually or via invites
4. Creates a **team-owned season**
   * `TEAM#id#SEASON#2025SPRING`
5. Adds games + records at-bats (lineup required for IN_PROGRESS)
6. Team dashboard shows cumulative stats

**PERSONAL Teams:**
1. User creates a PERSONAL team (`TEAM#id` with `team_type: PERSONAL`)
2. Owner player is auto-created and linked (uses user's firstName)
3. Cannot add additional players (validation blocks it)
4. Creates games for personal stat tracking (no lineup required)
5. User can create multiple PERSONAL teams to filter stats by context (e.g., "Monday League", "Weekend Warriors")
6. Personal teams enable filtering: "What was my batting average for Weekend Warriors during Spring 2025?"

### 8.3 League Flow

1. League admin creates league (`LEAGUE#id`)
2. Creates **league-owned season**
   * `LEAGUE#id#SEASON#2025SPRING`
3. Adds teams via `TEAMSEASONLINK` (`LEAGUE#id#SEASON#id` ‚Üí `TEAM#id`)
4. Creates league games
5. Sync Lambda mirrors read-only season + games to all teams
6. League dashboard aggregates standings & leaderboards

### 8.4 Free Agent Flow

1. Player opts into `FREEAGENCY#<region>`
2. Teams query by position/region
3. Coach sends invite
4. Player accepts ‚Üí temporary roster record created (`TEAM#id` + `PLAYER#id`, `status=sub`)
5. Optional auto-expiration after game

---

## üóëÔ∏è 9. Data Deletion & Retention

### Core Principles

| Concept              | Meaning                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ownership**        | Who controls and edits the data (User / Team / League)         |
| **Dependency**       | Who relies on the data (e.g., teams depending on league seasons) |
| **Mirroring**        | Read-only copies shared down the hierarchy (League ‚Üí Team)      |
| **Promotion**        | When owner is deleted, dependents inherit the mirrored data     |
| **Pseudonymization** | Replace personal details with anonymous labels                  |
| **Retention**        | Keep deleted data for 30 days before permanent cleanup          |

### Deletion Behavior

| Entity                  | On User Deletion                      | On Team Deletion                           | On League Deletion                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| User Profile            | Hard delete (30-day grace)            | N/A                                        | N/A                                 |
| Player Stats / At-Bats  | Retain, anonymize name/email          | Retain (still linked to team/season)       | Retain                              |
| Team Roster             | Remove player link                    | Delete team record                         | Retain if mirrored to league        |
| Team Games / Seasons    | Retain                                | Delete team data                           | Promote from league if mirrored     |
| League Seasons / Games  | N/A                                   | N/A                                        | Promote all team mirrors to ownership |

**Key Rules:**
- ‚úÖ Never delete gameplay stats outright
- ‚úÖ Always anonymize instead of removing user info
- ‚úÖ League deletion promotes data to team ownership
- ‚úÖ Soft delete first, hard delete after 30-day retention
- ‚úÖ Audit every deletion for traceability

## üß± 12. Testing Strategy

* **Unit tests:** Mocked DynamoDB (`moto`)
* **Integration tests:** Lambda ‚Üí API Gateway flow
* **Frontend tests:** Flutter widget tests + integration tests
* **End-to-end:** Simulate full user ‚Üí team ‚Üí league workflow

### Current Testing Approach

- **Local Testing:** Direct Lambda invocation with simulated events
- **Cloud Testing:** HTTP requests to deployed API Gateway
- **Database:** DynamoDB Local for development, AWS DynamoDB for staging/prod

**See:** [TESTING.md](../TESTING.md) for detailed workflows

---

## üìä 13. Monitoring & Logging

* CloudWatch structured logs (JSON)
* Custom metric filters:
  * `GamesCreatedCount`
  * `AtBatsRecordedCount`
  * `SyncLagSeconds`
* Alarms on Lambda error rate > 5%

### Current Implementation

- Structured JSON logging in all Lambda functions
- Log levels: INFO, WARN, ERROR
- CloudWatch Logs retention: 7 days
- X-Ray tracing: Not yet enabled

---

## üåé 14. Future Enhancements

### 14.1 Dedicated Stats Aggregation Service

**Problem:**
- Current approach: Stream-driven Lambda computes stats on every at-bat
- At scale (100k+ at-bats): race conditions, write contention, high costs

**Solution:**
- Dedicated stats-aggregator Lambda/service
- Subscribes to `ATBAT` Stream events
- Buffers writes via SQS (batch 100-500 updates)
- Time-based aggregates: `PLAYERSTATS#<playerId>#2025-04`

### 14.2 Central Policy Engine (‚úÖ Implemented)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (v2 Policy Engine)

**See:** [authorization.md](./authorization.md)

### 14.3 Other Enhancements

* **GraphQL layer (AppSync)** ‚Üí real-time stat updates
* **Global Tables** ‚Üí Multi-region replication
* **Stripe integration** ‚Üí League billing
* **AI stat detection** ‚Üí from video input
* **Open API** ‚Üí Public data feed for scoreboards

## ‚úÖ 15. Guiding Principles

| Principle                     | Explanation                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Ownership Clarity**         | Each entity has one source of truth              |
| **Mirroring, Not Merging**    | League ‚Üí team syncs are one-way                  |
| **Context-Aware Permissions** | Role + `ownerType` define editability            |
| **Event-Driven Sync**         | Streams keep all layers up to date               |
| **Mobile-First Design**       | Core flows optimized for coaches/players in-game |
| **Serverless Simplicity**     | Lambda-first, no servers to manage               |
| **Idempotency**               | All operations safe to retry                     |
| **Cognito Sub as User ID**    | Use stable Cognito sub instead of random UUIDs   |
| **Instant UX**                | Persistent caching + optimistic UI               |
| **Zero Knowledge Handlers**   | Handlers ask "can I do X?" not "who can do X?"   |

---

## üîß 16. Development Guidelines

### DynamoDB Best Practices

1. **Use Cognito sub as userId** - Eliminates need for cross-referencing
2. **Conditional writes** - Prevent overwrites with `ConditionExpression`
3. **Handle retries gracefully** - Catch `ConditionalCheckFailedException`
4. **Lowercase resource names** - All Terraform resources use lowercase
5. **Consistent field ordering** - PK/SK first, then user data, then GSI keys

### Lambda Best Practices

1. **Shared utilities** - Common code in `src/utils/`
2. **Field validation** - Explicit allowed/readonly field lists
3. **Auto-timestamps** - Always update `updatedAt` on modifications
4. **Proper error handling** - Distinguish between retries and real errors
5. **API Gateway v2.0** - All API Lambdas use payload format 2.0
6. **Use authorize()** - v2 Policy Engine for all authorization checks
7. **Global DynamoDB client** - Instantiate client and table in global scope for warm-start reuse
8. **Performance optimization** - Reuse connections across Lambda invocations

### Flutter Best Practices

1. **Use ConsumerWidget** - All screens that need Riverpod access
2. **Use ConsumerStatefulWidget** - For screens with local state + Riverpod
3. **AsyncNotifier for API data** - Built-in caching and state management (Riverpod v3)
4. **Watch providers in build** - Use `ref.watch()` to listen for changes
5. **Read providers for actions** - Use `ref.read()` in callbacks/methods
6. **Use optimistic mutations** - All CRUD operations use `notifier.mutate()` pattern
7. **Temp IDs for adds** - Use `temp-${timestamp}` prefix for optimistic adds
8. **Capture originals for rollback** - Save original item before update/delete
9. **Rollback from current state** - Never revert to snapshots (race condition risk)
10. **RefreshIndicator for manual refresh** - Allow users to force data refresh
11. **Handle all AsyncValue states** - loading, error, and data cases
12. **Show loading for temp items** - Check `id.startsWith('temp-')` in UI
13. **Centralized styling** - Use `Theme.of(context).textTheme` and `CustomTextStyles` extension
14. **Persistent caching** - Data survives app restarts using Shared Preferences
15. **Material 3 theme** - Comprehensive text styles with Tektur font configuration
16. **Custom extensions** - `CustomTextStyles` for unique app-specific styles
17. **Decoration utilities** - `DecorationStyles` class for common BoxDecoration patterns
