# Personal Stats Team - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented automatic creation of "Personal Stats" teams for every user on signup. These teams serve as invisible containers for at-bats not linked to any real team, enabling seamless stat aggregation across all teams using the existing GSI4 architecture.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes

1. **Personal Team Helper** (`src/utils/personal_team.py`)
   - `create_personal_team()` function
   - Atomically creates 3 records: Team, Membership, Player
   - Uses DynamoDB transaction for consistency

2. **User Creation Lambda** (`src/users/create/handler.py`)
   - Automatically creates personal team after user signup
   - Graceful error handling (doesn't fail signup if personal team fails)

3. **Authorization Safeguards** (`src/utils/authorization.py`)
   - `check_personal_team_operation()` function
   - Blocks: manage_roster, delete_team, manage_team

4. **Lambda Handler Updates**
   - `src/players/add/handler.py` - Blocks adding players to personal teams
   - `src/teams/update/handler.py` - Blocks editing personal teams
   - `src/teams/delete/handler.py` - Blocks deleting personal teams
   - `src/teams/query/handler.py` - Filters personal teams from public lists

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - `DATA_MODEL.md` - Added `isPersonal` field and examples
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Referenced in plan

### Testing Updates

1. **User Test Script** (`scripts/test_users.py`)
   - Added verification of personal team creation
   - Checks for team, membership, and player records
   - Verifies GSI4 keys are populated

2. **Team Test Script** (`scripts/test_teams.py`)
   - Added `[PERSONAL]` indicator in team listings
   - Added TEST 9: Personal Team Restrictions
   - Tests delete, update, and public list filtering

## Database Schema

### Personal Team Record
```json
{
  "PK": "TEAM#<teamId>",
  "SK": "METADATA",
  "teamId": "<uuid>",
  "name": "Personal Stats",
  "ownerId": "<userId>",
  "status": "active",
  "isPersonal": true,
  "createdAt": "<timestamp>",
  "updatedAt": "<timestamp>",
  "GSI2PK": "ENTITY#TEAM",
  "GSI2SK": "METADATA#<teamId>"
}
```

### Personal Player Record
```json
{
  "PK": "TEAM#<teamId>",
  "SK": "PLAYER#<playerId>",
  "playerId": "<uuid>",
  "teamId": "<teamId>",
  "firstName": "<user's first name>",
  "status": "active",
  "isGhost": false,
  "userId": "<userId>",
  "linkedAt": "<timestamp>",
  "createdAt": "<timestamp>",
  "updatedAt": "<timestamp>",
  "GSI4PK": "USER#<userId>",
  "GSI4SK": "PLAYER#<playerId>"
}
```

## Test Results

### User Creation Test
✅ User record created
✅ Personal team created with `isPersonal: true`
✅ Membership record created (role: team-owner)
✅ Personal player created and linked
✅ GSI4 keys populated for stat queries

### Team Restrictions Test
✅ Cannot delete personal team (403 Forbidden)
✅ Cannot update personal team (403 Forbidden)
✅ Cannot add players to personal team (403 Forbidden)
✅ Personal team filtered from public team lists
✅ Personal team appears in user's own team list with `[PERSONAL]` indicator

## Usage

### For Users
- Personal team is automatically created on signup
- Invisible in normal team operations
- Will be used for recording at-bats from non-team games
- Enables stat aggregation across all teams

### For Developers
```python
# Check if team is personal
if team.get('isPersonal'):
    # Handle personal team UI differently
    pass

# Query all user's players (including personal team player)
# Uses GSI4: USER#<userId> -> PLAYER#<playerId>
```

### For Testing
```bash
# Test user creation with personal team
make db-reset
make test create

# Test team operations with personal team restrictions
uv run python scripts/test_teams.py full-test <userId>

# Query user's teams (includes personal team)
uv run python scripts/test_teams.py query user <userId>

# Query all teams (personal teams filtered out)
uv run python scripts/test_teams.py query list
```

## Future Enhancements

### Frontend (Not Yet Implemented)
- Filter personal teams from team selection UI
- Hide roster/lineup/settings tabs for personal teams
- Only show games and at-bats for personal teams
- Use personal team player ID when aggregating stats

### Backend (Future Considerations)
- Handle personal team deletion when user is deleted
- Add recovery mechanism for missing personal teams
- Consider personal team data in exports
- Add analytics for personal vs team stats

## Deployment

All Lambda functions have been packaged and are ready for deployment:

```bash
# Package all Lambdas
uv run python scripts/package_lambdas.py

# Deploy to AWS
cd terraform && tf apply

# Verify in AWS Console
# - Check DynamoDB for personal team records
# - Test user signup creates personal team
# - Verify API Gateway restrictions work
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Seamless Stats Aggregation** - GSI4 enables querying all player records for a user
2. **No Schema Changes** - Uses existing table structure
3. **Atomic Creation** - Transaction ensures consistency
4. **Graceful Degradation** - User signup succeeds even if personal team fails
5. **Future-Proof** - Ready for games/at-bats feature implementation
6. **Invisible to Users** - No UI clutter, works in background
