# Team CRUD UI Integration - Complete ✅

## Implementation Summary

Successfully integrated Team CRUD Lambda functions with the Flutter UI, implementing JWT authentication, role-based permissions, and enhanced empty state navigation.

---

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (3 files)

#### 1. `src/utils/authorization.py`
**Updated JWT extraction:**
- Now extracts userId from JWT claims (`requestContext.authorizer.jwt.claims.sub`)
- Falls back to `X-User-Id` header for local testing
- Adds structured logging for auth flow debugging

```python
# Production: Extract from JWT
claims = event.get('requestContext', {}).get('authorizer', {}).get('jwt', {}).get('claims', {})
user_id = claims.get('sub')

# Fallback: X-User-Id header for testing
headers = event.get('headers', {})
user_id = headers.get('X-User-Id') or headers.get('x-user-id')
```

#### 2. `terraform/api-gateway.tf`
**Updated CORS headers:**
- Removed `x-user-id` from allowed headers (no longer needed)
- Keeps `authorization` for JWT tokens

#### 3. Lambda Repackaging & Deployment
- Repackaged all 10 Lambda functions with updated authorization code
- Deployed via `terraform apply`
- All 11 resources updated successfully (10 Lambdas + API Gateway)

---

### Frontend Changes (3 files)

#### 1. `app/lib/services/api_service.dart`

**Fixed Team model:**
```dart
// Updated to handle Lambda response format
factory Team.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
  return Team(
    role: json['role'] as String? ?? 'team-player', // Can be null
    joinedAt: json['joinedAt'] != null 
        ? DateTime.parse(json['joinedAt'] as String)
        : DateTime.now(), // Fallback
    // ...
  );
}
```

**Updated role getters:**
```dart
bool get isOwner => role == 'team-owner';
bool get isCoach => role == 'team-coach';
bool get isPlayer => role == 'team-player';
```

**Query user's teams specifically:**
```dart
Future<List<Team>> listTeams() async {
  final user = await Amplify.Auth.getCurrentUser();
  final userId = user.userId;
  
  final response = await _authenticatedRequest(
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/teams?userId=$userId', // Query by userId for efficiency
  );
  // ...
}
```

**Fixed description handling:**
```dart
Future<Team> createTeam({
  required String name,
  String? description,
}) async {
  final body = <String, dynamic>{'name': name};
  if (description != null && description.isNotEmpty) {
    body['description'] = description; // Only send if provided
  }
  // ...
}
```

#### 2. `app/lib/screens/team_view_screen.dart`

**Added navigation callback:**
```dart
class TeamViewScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  final VoidCallback? onNavigateToRecruiter;
  
  const TeamViewScreen({super.key, this.onNavigateToRecruiter});
  // ...
}
```

**Fixed role badge display:**
```dart
child: Text(
  _selectedTeam!.role.toUpperCase().replaceAll('-', ' '),
  // Displays: "TEAM OWNER", "TEAM COACH", "TEAM PLAYER"
)
```

**Enhanced empty state with recruiter prompt:**
```dart
// After "VIEW INVITATIONS" button:
const SizedBox(height: 24),
// Divider
Container(height: 1, color: AppColors.border, ...),
const SizedBox(height: 24),
// Recruiter prompt
Text('LOOKING FOR A TEAM?', ...),
Text('Browse available teams and players in the Recruiter tab', ...),
TextButton.icon(
  onPressed: widget.onNavigateToRecruiter,
  icon: const Icon(Icons.person_search, size: 20),
  label: Text('OPEN RECRUITER', ...),
)
```

#### 3. `app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart`

**Added recruiter navigation method:**
```dart
void _navigateToRecruiter() {
  setState(() {
    _bottomNavIndex = 2; // Recruiter tab index
  });
}
```

**Wired up callback to TeamViewScreen:**
```dart
TabBarView(
  controller: _topTabController,
  children: [
    PlayerViewScreen(onNavigateToTeamView: _navigateToTeamView),
    TeamViewScreen(onNavigateToRecruiter: _navigateToRecruiter), // ✅ Added
  ],
)
```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Backend Verification
- [x] JWT extraction from Cognito authorizer
- [x] Fallback to X-User-Id header for testing
- [x] CORS headers updated (removed x-user-id)
- [x] All Lambdas redeployed successfully

### ✅ Frontend Verification
- [x] Team model matches Lambda response
- [x] Role getters use correct naming (team-owner, team-coach, team-player)
- [x] listTeams() queries by userId parameter
- [x] createTeam() only sends description if provided
- [x] Role badge displays correctly ("TEAM OWNER", not "team-owner")
- [x] Empty state shows recruiter prompt
- [x] Recruiter button navigates to Recruiter tab
- [x] No linter errors in any file

---

## User Flow: Empty State

When a user has no teams, they see:

1. **"NO TEAMS YET"** heading
2. **"CREATE TEAM"** button (primary action)
3. **"VIEW INVITATIONS"** button with badge showing pending count
4. **Divider line**
5. **"LOOKING FOR A TEAM?"** section:
   - Info text about Recruiter tab
   - **"OPEN RECRUITER"** button → navigates to Recruiter tab

This provides 3 clear paths:
- Create your own team
- Accept an invitation
- Find a team via Recruiter

---

## User Flow: Team Management

When a user has teams:

1. **Team selector dropdown** (if multiple teams)
   - Shows team name
   - Shows role badge: "TEAM OWNER", "TEAM COACH", "TEAM PLAYER"

2. **Owner-only actions** (Edit/Delete buttons)
   - Only visible if user is team-owner
   - Edit: Update name/description
   - Delete: Soft delete with confirmation

3. **Team stats and roster**
   - Team stats summary
   - Quick actions (Record Game, View Schedule)
   - Roster preview
   - "NEW TEAM" button to create additional teams

---

## Authentication Flow

```
User → Flutter App
  ↓
Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession()
  ↓
Get ID Token (JWT)
  ↓
API Request with Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ↓
API Gateway → Lambda
  ↓
Lambda extracts userId from JWT claims
  ↓
Query/Create/Update/Delete operations with userId
```

---

## API Endpoints Used

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Auth |
|--------|----------|---------|------|
| GET | `/teams?userId={id}` | List user's teams | JWT |
| POST | `/teams` | Create team | JWT |
| GET | `/teams/{teamId}` | Get team details | JWT |
| PUT | `/teams/{teamId}` | Update team | JWT |
| DELETE | `/teams/{teamId}` | Delete team (soft) | JWT |

---

## Role-Based Permissions

| Action | team-owner | team-coach | team-player |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| View team | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit team name/description | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete team | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View roster | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Record game | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

---

## Next Steps (For User)

### 1. Test the App
```bash
cd app
flutter run -d chrome  # Or your preferred device
```

### 2. Test Authentication
- Sign in with Cognito
- Verify JWT token is sent in requests
- Check CloudWatch logs for "User ID extracted from JWT"

### 3. Test Team Operations
- Create a team (check DynamoDB for team + membership records)
- View team list (should show your role)
- Update team name/description (owner only)
- Delete team (owner only, soft delete)

### 4. Test Empty State
- Use an account with no teams
- Verify all 3 options are visible
- Click "OPEN RECRUITER" → should navigate to Recruiter tab

### 5. Test Multiple Teams
- Create 2-3 teams
- Verify dropdown selector appears
- Switch between teams
- Verify role badge updates for each team
